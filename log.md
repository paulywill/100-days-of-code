### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued to struggle with the Fib challenge on fcc. Finally looked at the spoiler. Was on the wrong track with trying recursive.

**Thoughts**: 
Was very frustrated. Also was a little rude in front of company logging in late just before midnight and after a few beers. Not the ideal state of mind.
